This is a collection of modules I find generally useful.

Documentation
==================

I know I'm pretty light on this. There's some ddocs but for the most part, I kinda expect you to use it the way I do: hoping things are logical and looking
at the source to fill in the gaps.

You can always catch me on email though: destructionator@gmail.com. That's
the most reliable way to reach me.

Basic idea
===================

Modules are usually independent; you don't need this whole directory
but it doesn't hurt to grab it all either.

I like to compile by just passing all the modules to the command line
at once. For example: dmd yourapp.d cgi.d. That's why I don't bother
with a separate arsd/ directory nor with dub packages. Passing the files
is faster to compile and easier to use!

Read more about the modules at these links (docs are still works in process):

cgi.d info: http://arsdnet.net/web.d/cgi.d.html
web.d info: http://arsdnet.net/web.d/web.d.html

64 Bit
=============

Believe it or not, but I still mostly use 32 bit programs myself. I try
to keep things working on 64 bit, but don't always test it. If something
doesn't compile or work on 64 bit, email me and I'll see about fixing it.

I also tend to run a version behind bleeding-edge dmd, so sometimes things
break there too. Again, if that's a problem, just email me and I can typically
get you a fix in about an hour.

Currently included are:

Web related
================

cgi.d  - base module for making webapps in D. Supports cgi, fastcgi, scgi, and embedded_httpd via -version=xxxx
dom.d  - an xml/html DOM based on what Javascript provides in browsers
web.d  - a fancier way to write web apps. Uses reflection to make functions
         accessible via url with minimal boilerplate in your code
email.d - gives read and write support for emails, sending via SMTP and
          reading mbox files

web.d.php - a PHP library meant to ease integration of php components
	    with web.d apps. Gives (read) access to the session, and full
	    access to your D ApiProviders.

html.d - functions to manipulate HTML documents, and now css and javascript
	 with DOM functions, nested css statements, and macros for css and js.

oauth.d - Oauth 1.0 implementation with some helper functions for facebook, twitter, etc.
htmltotext.d - converts html into plain text

rtud.d - a real time update helper for HTML5 EventSource. Kinda buggy.

Database related
================

database.d  - main interface to databases. Includes DataObject
mysql.d     - a mysql engine for database.d (most mature of the three). also includes some basic ORM
postgres.d  - a postgres engne for database.d
sqlite.d    - a sqlite engine for database.d
mssql.d     - a (super crappy) mssql engine for database.d (uses ODBC)
querygenerator.d - a user submission for generating sql queries

Desktop app stuff
================

simpledisplay.d - gives quick and easy access to a window for drawing and input. Also has some OpenGL capabilities.
minigui.d - a small widgetset built on top of simpledisplay.d offering buttons, checkboxes, etc.
terminal.d - quick and easy access to a text mode console/terminal
htmlwidget.d - a very small html widget, built on simpledisplay.d

Game stuff
=================

engine.d, screen.d, audio.d - a quick wrapper to SDL and OpenGL I used
         in the pre D1 days, now updated so it compiles as both D1 and
	 D2 (use the -d switch to dmd)

	 Requires some SDL bindings.

	 Eventually I'll redo it.

Reading Common Files
=================
bmp.d  - basic .bmp file read/write support
png.d  - provides some png read/write support
jpg.d  - just reading jpg header right now
csv.d  - gives read support to csv files

Cool stuff
================
jsvar.d - gives a dynamic type in D similar to Javascript's var
script.d - a little script interpreter whose language is like a hybrid of D and Javascript (builds on jsvar.d)

Other
================

stb_truetype.d - a port of the nice little C library stb_truetype.h to D for drawing text without external dependencies

eventloop.d - first draft of a generic event loop that can be reused by several libraries
              try it with terminal.d or simpledisplay.d with -version=with_eventloop. Only
              works on Linux right now.
sha.d  - implementations of the SHA1 and SHA256 algorithms
curl.d - a small wrapper around the curl library
http.d - a lighterweight alternative to curl.d
color.d - a basic color struct and some HSL functions. Also includes really basic image classes
	on which png.d, bmp.d, and others depend, and now some quantization and dithering algorithms.
characterencodings.d - conversion to UTF8 of various encodings


Obsolete
================
image.d - now merged into color.d
lazypng.d - now merged into png.d
httpd.d - old http server, use cgi.d with -version=embedded_httpd instead
netman.d - old network helper code, you should try vibe.d <http://vibed.org/> or maybe
           cgi.d's threaded thing instead since this one is now unmaintained and poor in
           quality compared to vibe anyway.
domconvenience.d - now merged into dom.d


Things I'll add when I get the time:

event.d - reading Linux's /dev/event e.g. for second keyboards and usb joysticks
browser.d - a tiny browser based on htmlwidget.d
wav.d  - reading and writing WAV files
midi.d - reading and writing MIDI files (I actually need to port it from C still!)
simpleaudio.d - gives minimal audio output
minimal.zip - a set of minimal D functions, works on bare metal. see: http://arsdnet.net/dcode/minimal.zip
